# FSJS-project-6

Hey there! I am shooting for exceeds and would appreciate it if anything less
than exceeds was sent back as needs improvement.

Here are the CSS changes I made:

  * At 1600px wide I made some changes to center the main
    document.  I felt like it was heavily on the left side
    of the page for anything beyond a tablet sized screen.
    Here is a list of the changes I made:
    - gave the body a background color
    - made a div "container" with a width of 1520,
      centered, position: relative, background-color: white,
      and a minimum height of 100vh.
    - gave the .off-canvas side nav position absolute.

  * I changed the headers font to Montserrat because it
    is my wife's favorite <3

  * I added some styling to the error page:
    - margin/padding etc.
    - added button styles to the stack trace button
    - added jQuery to have stack trace appear only if user
      wanted to see it.

I feel like this constitutes at least 3 changes!

All of the changes are at the bottom of the style.css.

Thanks for taking your time to review my project!
